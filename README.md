# Friend Finder

Friend Finder is a web application that takes in users' results from a survey to find a compatible match. Friend Finder will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Technologies Used

-Express
-Path
-Handlebars
-Node.js
-Heroku

## How it works

When Friend Finder is first opened it leads to a landing page. When a user clicks on the "Survey" button it takes them to the survey. The user is asked to put in a username and insert a link to photo, and answer 10 questions. Using MySQL database, the answers are stored. The application uses express and path to access the answers from other users to make the best match. The app is hosted through Heroku so that other users can use it and find a their best match.
